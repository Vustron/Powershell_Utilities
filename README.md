<summary><strong>cleanup.ps1 üßπ</strong></summary>

The `cleanup.ps1` script will remove specific folders from a given directory. I made this script because of the slow deletion of cache folders in my nextjs projects on Windows 11 file explorer.

```powershell
.\cleanup.ps1
```

- `-dryRun`: If specified, the script will only display the folders that would be removed without actually deleting them.
- `-verbose`: If specified, the script will display additional information about the folders being scanned.

### Example

```powershell
.\cleanup.ps1 -path "C:\Projects\MyApp" -dryRun -verbose
```
